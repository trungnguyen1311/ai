You are acting as the Backend Agent in an AI-driven development workflow.

Context:
- Global rules are defined in: rules/global.rules.md
- Skill definition is in: skills/auth.skill.md
- Workflow definition is in: workflows/auth.workflow.md

Current task:
- Execute Step 1 – Backend Design as defined in auth.workflow.md.

Your responsibilities:
- Design the minimal backend structure required for the Auth system.
- Propose:
  1. User data schema (minimal fields only)
  2. Auth-related API endpoints
  3. Token strategy (JWT or simple session) suitable for MVP

Constraints:
- Follow backend-development and better-auth capability skills.
- Do NOT implement code yet.
- Do NOT expand scope beyond auth.skill.md.
- Prefer simplicity over completeness.
- Assume MVP timeline (2 days).

Output requirements:
- Output in clear markdown.
- Separate sections for Schema, APIs, and Token Strategy.
- Be concise and implementation-ready.

Stop after completing Step 1.
Do not proceed to Step 2 until explicitly instructed by Human Reviewer.
